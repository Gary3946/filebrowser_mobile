# Privacy Policy

**App:** File Browser Mobile (`com.filebrowser_quantum_mobile`)
**Last updated:** 2026-07-28

File Browser Mobile is a client app for self-hosted [File Browser](https://filebrowser.org/) servers. It connects only to the server address you enter yourself.

## Data we collect

None. The app has no analytics, no crash reporting, no advertising, and no tracking of any kind. The developer never receives any data from your device.

## Data stored on your device

- **Server address and login credentials** — stored locally in Android's encrypted storage (Android Keystore via `flutter_secure_storage`) so you can sign in again without retyping them. They are sent only to the server you configured, over the connection you configured.
- **Biometric unlock** — if you enable it, authentication is handled entirely by Android's system biometric prompt. The app never sees, stores, or transmits your fingerprint or face data.
- **Preferences** (sort order, view settings) — stored locally.
- **Downloaded files and cached thumbnails** — stored locally in the app's storage.

All of this is deleted when you uninstall the app or clear its data.

## Network traffic

The app communicates exclusively with the File Browser server you configure. There are no third-party servers, no telemetry endpoints, and no requests to the developer. The privacy of data on your server is governed by whoever operates that server — typically you.

## Permissions

- **Internet** — to reach your server.
- **Biometrics** — optional app unlock.
- **Notifications / foreground service** — progress for background uploads and downloads.

## Children

The app does not collect data from anyone, including children.

Changes to this policy will be published at this URL with an updated date.
